// The `string` type represents immutable sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. 
// There is no separate character type: a character is represented by string of lenght 1.
// Two `string` values are `==` if both sequences have same characters. 
// You can use `< <= > >=` operators on `string` values and they work by comparing code points. 
// Unpaired surrogates are not allowed.
