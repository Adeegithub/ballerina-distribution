// `map<T>` is a `map` from strings to `T`. `map` syntax is similar to `JSON`. Maps are mutable.
// `foreach` will iterate over values of the `map`. Use `m.get(k)` when you know that there is an entry for `k`.
// `m.keys()` can be used to iterate over keys, to get the keys as an `array` of strings.
// `==` and `!=` on maps is deep: two maps are equal if they have the same set of keys
// and the values for each key are equal.
