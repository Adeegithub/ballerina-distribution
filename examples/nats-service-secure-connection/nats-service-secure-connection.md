# NATS service - SSL/TLS

The NATS server uses TLS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. TLS can be used to encrypt traffic between the client/server and check the serverâ€™s identity. In this example, the underlying connection of the listener is secured with TLS/SSL. A secured NATS listener is created by passing the URL of the NATS broker and providing the TLS/SSL details using the `nats:SecureSocket` record. Use it to connect to a NATS server, which has SSL/TLS enabled.
