// A module-level variable can be declared as `configurable`. The initializer of a `configurable` variable
// can be overridden at runtime (e.g., by a TOML file). A variable where configuration is required
// can use an initializer of `?`. The type of a `configurable` variable must be subtype of `anydata`.
