// `RequestErrorInterceptor` is used to handle the errors occurred in the interceptor pipeline execution. 
// When an error returned from a `RequestInterceptor` service, intercetpor pipeline execution jumps to the 
// nearest `RequestErrorInterceptor`. However, if there is no `RequestErrorInterceptor` in the pipeline then  
// the error response is retunred to the client without executing the actual resource in the target service.
