# Assertions

Testerina has in-built assertions that enable you to assert an outcome against
an expected outcome. This example illustrates how to use different assertions.

For more information, see [Test ballerina code](https://ballerina.io/learn/test-ballerina-code/test-quick-start/)
and the [`test` module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/test/latest/).
