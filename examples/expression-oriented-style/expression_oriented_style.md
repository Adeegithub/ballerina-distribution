Ballerina's general philosophy is to make the programming syntax familiar to those familiar with the C-family of languages. It has a distinction between statements and expressions, just like in C. This is the imperative style of programming which is considered less intuitive. That's why there is a shift towards a functional style of programming that is more expression-oriented.
Ballerina provides a few options to make it possible to do more things with expressions, such as query expressions, constructor expressions for structured types, and nil expressions for functions returning nil values.
Here, are a few more things that you can do using expressions in Ballerina.
