// Interceptors are used to execute some common such as logging, header manipulation,
// state publishing, etc. for all the inbound requests and outbound responses. A 
// `RequestInterceptor` can be used to intercept the request and execute some custom
// logic. `RequestInterceptors` have a resource method which will be executed
// before the request dispatched to the actual resource in the target service. In addition to this,
// A `ResponseInterceptor` can be used to intercept the response. `ResponseInterceptors`
// have a remote method which will be executed before the response dispatched to the client.
// These interceptors can be configured as a pipeline either at listener level or at service level.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
