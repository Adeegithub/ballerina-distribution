# Langlib functions

Langlib is a small library defined by the Ballerina language providing fundamental operations on the built-in data types. Langlib functions can be called using a convenient method-call syntax but these types are not objects. There exists a `ballerina/lang.T` module for each built-in type `T` and they are imported automatically using the `T` prefix.
