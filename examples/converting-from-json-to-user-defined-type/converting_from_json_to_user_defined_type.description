// With mutable values, would not be type-safe to allow a cast. 
// Mutable structures have inherent type that limits mutation.
// Cast to `T` will work on mutable structure `s` only if inherent type
// of `s` is subtype of `T`.
// Casting of immutable value will work, but does not do numeric conversions.
