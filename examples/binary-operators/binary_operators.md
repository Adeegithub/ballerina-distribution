# Binary operators

Ballerina provides several binary operators to perform operations on values of various types such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Binary arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) allow basic mathematical calculations between two values. The operators to compare values (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) produce a boolean result.

Ballerina also supports binary logical operators (`&&` and `||`) to perform logical operations on boolean values and bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, and `>>>`) to manipulate bits in integer values.
