# Binary operators

Ballerina provides several binary operators to perform operations on values of various types such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Binary arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) allow for basic mathematical calculations between two values. The operators for comparing values (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) produce a boolean result.

Ballerina also supports binary logical operators (`&&`, `||`) for performing logical operations on boolean values, as well as bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`) for manipulating individual bits in integer values.
