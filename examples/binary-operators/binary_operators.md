# Binary operators

Ballerina provides several binary operators to perform operations on various data types, such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Binary arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) allow for basic mathematical calculations between two values. Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) are used to compare two values and produce a boolean result.

In addition, Ballerina supports binary logical operators like && and || for combining boolean expressions, and bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>, >>>) for manipulating individual bits in integers. These operators enable efficient and flexible handling of binary data and logical operations in a concise manner.
