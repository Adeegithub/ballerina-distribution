# Create tables with a query

A query expressions can be used to create tables from an iterable value. One way of doing this is specifying `table` 
keyword as the query construct type before the query expression. The key of the created table can  be specified 
explicitly. Second way is to provide a contextually expected type. The `select` clause must emit values belonging 
to `map<any|error>`.
