// Errors occurred during the request-response pipeline can be intercepted and handled
// at `ResponseErrorInterceptors`. In addition to this, a `RequestErrorInterceptor` 
// can used to handle the errors that occurred in the request interceptor execution
// path. The `RequestErrorInterceptor` can sent a response message according to the 
// error just like a `ResponseErrorInterceptor`. In addition, it can modify the 
// request and dipatch it to the target service.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
