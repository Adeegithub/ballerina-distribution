// A `ResponseErrorInterceptor` is used to handle the errors that occurred in the response path i.e. 
// when an error is returned from the target service or a `ResponseInterceptor` service, the 
// interceptor pipeline execution jumps to the nearest `ResponseErrorInterceptor`. 
// In addition to this, when there is an error in the request path and there is no `RequestErrorInterceptor`,
// the interceptor pipeline execution jumps to the nearest `ResponseErrorInterceptor`.   
// However, if there is no `ResponseErrorInterceptor` in the pipeline, then, 
// the error response is returned to the client.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
