# Unary operators

Ballerina supports unary operators that perform operations on a single operand. The unary negation operator (-) negates the value of a numeric type, effectively changing its sign. The bitwise NOT operator (~) inverts the bits of an integer, converting each 0 to 1 and each 1 to 0. For boolean values, the logical NOT operator (!) inverts the boolean value, changing true to false and vice versa. These unary operators provide essential functionality for manipulating individual values efficiently.
