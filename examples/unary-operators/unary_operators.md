# Unary operators

Ballerina supports unary operators that perform operations on a single operand. The unary `-` operator negates the value of a numeric type, effectively changing its sign. The unary `+` operator returns the value of the expression it is applied to, as long as that expression is a number. The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) inverts the bits of an integer, converting each 0 to 1 and each 1 to 0. 

For boolean values, the logical NOT operator (`!`) inverts the boolean value, changing true to false and vice versa.
