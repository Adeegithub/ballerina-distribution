# HTTP service - Basic authentication file user store

The `http:Service` can be secured with basic authentication and optionally, by enforcing authorization. This can be achieved by validating the basic authentication token sent in the `Authorization` header against the provided configurations in the `Config.toml` file. This file stores the usernames and passwords for the authentication and the scopes for the authorization. An `http:Service` can configure the scopes it needs for authorization in the `auth` field of the `@http:ServiceConfig` annotation. 

A `401 Unauthorized` response is sent to the client when the authentication fails, and a `403 Forbidden` response is sent to the client when the authorization fails. Use this to authenticate and authorize requests based onÂ user stores. Furthermore, the authentication and authorization configurations can be overwritten at the resource level using the `@http:ResourceConfig` annotation.
