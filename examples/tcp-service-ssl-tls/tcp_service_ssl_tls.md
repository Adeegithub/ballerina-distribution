# TCP service - SSL/TLS 

This demonstrates how the Ballerina TCP service can be configured to secure the connection over SSL/TLS.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`tcp` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/tcp/latest).

>**Tip:** You may need to change the certificate file path and private key file path in the code below.

::: code tcp_service_ssl_tls.bal :::

Run the service by executing the command below.

::: out tcp_service_ssl_tls.out :::

>**Info:** You can invoke the above service via the [TCP SSL/TLS client](/learn/by-example/tcp-client-ssl-tls/).
