# Iterative Use of Typed Binding Patterns

The iterative use is always followed by the `in` keyword. In this approach, an iterator gets created as a result of evaluating an expression, and the typed binding pattern is matched against each value returned by the iterator. The `in` keyword can be used with `foreach` statement, `from` clause and `join` clause in query expressions, and with `let` expression.
