// The goal is to support for namespaces, but no added complexity if you donâ€™t use them. Qualified name
// `ns:x` in XML is expanded into `{url}x` where `url` is the namespace name bound to `ns`. XML namespace
// declarations are kept as attributes using standard binding of `xmlns` to
// [http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/](http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/).
