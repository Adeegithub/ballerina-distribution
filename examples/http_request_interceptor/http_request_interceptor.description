// HTTP Listener supports intercepting request in the request path. Its possible to
// define a `RequestInterceptor` service class with a resource function to execute 
// custom logic and engage to a HTTP Listener. The request will go through the 
// interceptor services before its dispatched to the actual resource in the target 
// service.
