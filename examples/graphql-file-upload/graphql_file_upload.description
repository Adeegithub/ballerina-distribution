// GraphQL package provides a way to upload files through the GraphQL endpoints with GraphQL mutations. To define
// an endpoint with the file upload capability, the `graphql:Upload` type can be used as the input parameter of
// resolver functions. The `graphql:Upload` type can represents details of the file that need to be uploaded and
// that can be used only with the remote functions. The value of `graphql:Upload` type is extracted from the HTTP  
// multipart request receiving to the GraphQL endpoints. This example shows how to implement an GraphQL endpoint that 
// can be used to upload files.

// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [`graphql` package](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
