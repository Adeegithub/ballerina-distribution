# Destructure records using queries

Destructuring records is particularly useful with the query expressions but works anywhere you can have `var`. `var` is followed by a binding pattern. You can also explicitly specify the type before the binding pattern without using `var`.

`{x}` is short for `{x: x}` in both binding patterns and record constructors.
