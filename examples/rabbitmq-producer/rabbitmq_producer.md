# RabbitMQ client - Produce a message

In this example, the producer is sending a single message to the pre-declared queue, MyQueue. See `RabbitMQ client - Declare a queue` sample for more details on declaring the queue.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`rabbitmq` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/rabbitmq/latest).
