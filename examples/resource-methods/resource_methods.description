// Service objects use `remote` methods to expose services in procedural style: remote methods are named by verbs. <br/><br/>
// Service objects user `resource` methods to expose services in an RESTful style: resources are named by nounds. <br/><br/>
// Resources are motivated by HTTP, but are general enough also to work for GraphQL. 
// `resource` methods are network-oriented generalization of OO getter/setter concept.
