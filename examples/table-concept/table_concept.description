// Ballerina encourages use of its built-in data structures: `array`, `map` and `table`. A `table` is a
// collection of records; each `record` represents a row of the `table`. A `table` is plain data if
// and only if its rows are plain data. Table maintains invariant that each row is uniquely identified
// by a key. Each rowâ€™s key is stored in fields, which must be immutable. <br></br>
// Compared to maps: <br></br>
// - key is part of the value, rather than separate. <br></br>
// - type of the key is not restricted to `string`. <br></br>
// - order of members is preserved. <br></br>
