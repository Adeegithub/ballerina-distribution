// This example demonstrates how the Ballerina tcp client can be configured to
// connect to an SSL/TLS listener through 1-way SSL/TLS connection 
// (i.e., the server is verified by the client). This example uses the Ballerina
// tcp listener to host a service and the tcp client sends 
// requests for that listener.

// For more information on the underlying module, see the [TCP module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/tcp/latest/tcp).
